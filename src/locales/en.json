      "details": "EXCEPTIONAL CARE – EVERY DAY, EVERY MEAL. Nature’s Protection Superior Care White Dogs Lamb Adult Small and Mini Breeds is more than just food. It is a daily health system specially designed for small and very small breeds of light-coated dogs prone to allergies – from sensitive skin and digestion to tear stains. The grain-free formula with lamb – a hypoallergenic, easily digestible source of protein – helps maintain well-being and strengthen the skin, coat, and immune system. Lamb is enriched with iron, zinc, and B vitamins. The unique supplement Microzeogen®, dynamically micronized clinoptilolite, helps remove toxins from the body, improves nutrient absorption, strengthens teeth, bones, and the balance of the intestinal microbiota – all of which contribute to the physical and emotional well-being of your pet. Every bite has a purpose. So that your dog can enjoy tasty yet functional food and always have a healthy, shiny coat without tear stains. NATURALNESS AND INNOVATION IN EVERY BITE. This food was not created in theory, but by living with dogs. Its formula was developed by scientists, veterinarians, nutritionists, and cynologists, and research at the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences confirmed: >90% nutrient absorption, fewer digestive problems, more beautiful skin and coat, more stable tear composition. This is a solution that does not mask, but solves the daily problems of sensitive dogs. CREATED WITH CARE – RIGHT HERE IN LITHUANIA. The entire production process takes place at a family business in Lithuania, where each batch is created with the same care as the first – for our own dogs. Only the highest quality, certified ingredients are used, and production is carried out using Lithuanian solar energy. Strict ISO standards are followed, and every bowl is made with responsibility in mind – towards the pet and the planet.",
